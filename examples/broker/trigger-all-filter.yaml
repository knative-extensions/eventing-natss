# Example Trigger with ALL filter (AND logic - new Subscriptions API)
#
# This trigger uses the "all" filter to require ALL conditions to be met.
# Only events that match every nested filter will be delivered.
#
# This example matches events where:
# - type equals "com.example.order.created" AND
# - source equals "/orders/premium"
